Sometimes we need to search log files with keywords, and normally, we also need to get the context of hitted log lines.
For example,when we get a log line which contains 'UserException', and we wanna know the user\_id or others, and this information located in the pre or next log lines.
This library is aim to solve the problems above. and purely written in Java.
